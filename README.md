# Research Project- Improving the Classification of Brain Tumors from MRI using Transfer Learning

## Description
In this project, pretrained CNN models (ResNet15, ResNet50, DenseNet, GoogLeNet, MobileNet, ShuffleNet, and VGG16) were tested on a MRI brain tumors data set to determine the model with the best accuracy. The significance of trainable layers was also tested by comparing the performance of each model with the convolutional base frozen and trained.
